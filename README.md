# <Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

A basic work day planner to plan out your daily tasks during the average 9-5 work day. This project is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

This project will allow users to set tasks throughout the day for them to complete to increase their time efficiency. Work Day Scheduler also will show users, with a clear color code, what time of day it is presently. It also shows what tasks should have been completed by now and which ones are coming up.

## Usage

To use the password generator:

1. Find the corresponding row for the time of day that you would like to designate to your task.
2. Click on the text field (Where the placeholder text says "Put your task here!" and type out your task!
3. Click on save to save your task to your local storage (Don't worry if you refresh or close the page, your task will be saved)
4. Refer to the work day scheduler to remind the user what tasks should be completed during which time blocks.
